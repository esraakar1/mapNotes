# mapNotes

This project allows users to add, edit, and delete notes on a map by selecting specific locations. The application retrieves the user's current location (or defaults to a predefined location) and lets them create notes based on that spot. It also includes a flight feature to jump to specific map locations.

## Features

- **Map Integration**: The map is integrated using Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap.
- **Add Notes**: Users can click on the map to add a note related to that location.
- **Edit and Delete Notes**: Notes can be edited and deleted from the map.
- **Geolocation**: The user's current location is fetched and used as the starting point for the map.
- **Flight Feature**: Ability to jump to a different location on the map with a click.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the map features, including adding, editing, and deleting notes.
- **Leaflet.js**: For rendering and interacting with the map.
- **LocalStorage**: For storing notes locally on the user's browser.
